            <h1>Case Study: Saba and Substance Abuse</h1>
        </header>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Saba (name changed) is a 23-year-old girl admitted to a Drug De-addiction Ward. Her bruised and 
                scarred limbs reflect her harrowing battle with addiction, making it difficult for her to walk. 
                The blue and purple spots around her veins are a stark reminder of years of intravenous heroin abuse.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Saba’s journey into heroin addiction began at the age of 20, when she decided to train as a paramedic. 
                She enrolled in a college in Punjab, only to later realize it was a scam that cost her parents one lakh rupees. 
                This financial loss forced her to seek part-time employment.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hostel mate introduced Saba to opportunities to earn money and eventually connected her with individuals 
                who offered “better earnings” through courier jobs. Initially unaware, Saba delivered consignments containing heroin. 
                Once she discovered the truth, her involvement deepened as she began snorting small amounts of the drug, encouraged 
                by colleagues who claimed it would make her fearless. Her habit soon escalated to injecting heroin.
            </p>

            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Saba started spending all her earnings as a heroin trafficker on the narcotic itself. Her family’s hopes for 
                her future were shattered as her addiction consumed her life. Saba, overwhelmed by guilt, repeatedly begged 
                her parents for more money under false pretenses, plunging her family further into debt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Saba struggles with feelings of despair and guilt. She admits, 
                <em>“Mostly, I feel like ending my life and putting a stop to the embarrassment that my parents feel when they look at me.”</em>
                Despite this, she regularly attends the hospital with her mother for opioid substitution therapy (OST), hoping for recovery.
            </p>

            <h2>Another Story</h2>
            <p>
                During one of her visits, Saba saw a 14-year-old girl being helped out of the OST room by her mother. This 
                frail, tired Class 8 student is also a heroin abuser, having been ‘chasing’ heroin for three months. 
                Bullying at a new school, older friends, easy access to money, and an over-controlling family led her to 
                this destructive path. She no longer attends school, highlighting the far-reaching effects of addiction.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges for Women in Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                According to Dr. Yasir Hussain Rather, a doctor at the Drug De-Addiction and Treatment Centre (DDTC) SMHS hospital, 
                the chances of women seeking treatment for substance abuse are far lower than those of men. The societal taboo and 
                stigmatization surrounding female addiction often result in prolonged suffering, as many avoid seeking help out of fear of judgment.
