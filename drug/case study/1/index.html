          <h1>Case Study on Drug Addiction: Analysis and Recommendations</h1>
          <section>
              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>Drug addiction is a growing issue in Bangladesh, particularly among the youth aged 18–30. Positioned geographically between the "Golden Triangle" and "Golden Crescent," the country is a transit hub for illicit drugs, exacerbating the prevalence of substance abuse. This case study examines a 24-year-old male named Delower, addicted to phensidyl, a cough syrup with addictive properties, for 4.5 years. The study highlights the physiological, psychological, and socio-economic impacts of addiction while suggesting strategic interventions for prevention and rehabilitation.</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Drug abuse is a pressing concern in Bangladesh, with millions affected. Factors like geographical transit routes facilitate drug trafficking, leading to increased addiction rates. A significant percentage of addicts fall within the age group of 18–35. Among various substances, cannabis, alcohol, phensidyl, heroin, and sedatives are most common. Male addicts outnumber females by 20:1, indicating gendered patterns in addiction prevalence.</p>

              <h2>Case Summary</h2>
              <p>The subject, Delower, was introduced to drugs by peers and progressed from cannabis to phensidyl, which he consumes four times daily. Symptoms without the drug include irritability, lack of motivation, anorexia, fever, and occasional vomiting. Physically, he appears frail, suffers from mild anemia, and exhibits signs of chronic drug dependency.</p>

          <section>
              <h2>Drug Analysis</h2>
              <p>Phensidyl contains promethazine, codeine, and ephedrine. While initially designed for therapeutic use, it is highly addictive due to its sedative and euphoric effects. Prolonged use results in severe side effects such as CNS depression, respiratory issues, and cardiovascular complications. Socially, the addiction drives individuals toward crime to finance their dependency.</p>

              <h2>Recommendations</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Reform of Administrative and Legal Systems:</strong> Rooting out corruption within narcotics control, law enforcement, and border management.</li>
                  <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Encouraging schools, colleges, and NGOs to play active roles in education and rehabilitation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Medical and Psychological Support:</strong> Providing accessible treatment for addicts, focusing on withdrawal management, and offering counseling services.</li>
                  <li><strong>Policy Changes:</strong> Restricting over-the-counter sales of addictive substances like phensidyl.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Drug addiction is both a medical and societal challenge. Addressing it requires a multi-faceted approach involving law enforcement, community support, and medical intervention. Strengthening family values and ethical education is crucial for long-term prevention. Through combined efforts, the spread of addiction can be curtailed, creating a healthier society.</p>
